# SPLOD
The Social Platform for Open Data (SPOD) enables social interactions among citizens around open datasets coming from different sources (dataset providers).
Beside a traditional social network, the discussions are organized in "Public Rooms", grouped in the Agora. 
Each user has also a personal space, called "My space", where it is possible to place visualization of open datasets, URLs and notes so that they can be re-used later in discussions.  
  
SPLOD (SPODLOD) is a project integrated in SPOD. The main purpose is to explore and interrogate Linked Open Data.
